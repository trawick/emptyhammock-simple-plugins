# Simple plugins for Django CMS

* Teaser for CMS page
* Teaser for URL (i.e., web page on another site)
* Text plugin for small snippets of text
* Text and image plugin

These are very simple, but they provide a unifying feature that I use in my
CMS projects:  The project can configure templates in `settings` along with
human-readable descriptions, and these plugins will present those choices
to the user on the plugin admin form.

## Support
