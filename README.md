# Simple plugins for Django CMS

* Teaser for CMS page
* Teaser for URL (i.e., web page on another site)
* Text plugin for small snippets of text
* Text and image plugin

These are very simple, but they provide a unifying feature that I use in my
CMS projects:  The project can configure templates in `settings` along with
human-readable descriptions, and these plugins will present those choices
to the user on the plugin admin form.

## Support

This package exists to support my own commercial activities.  Just maybe it can
provide other developers with a helpful hint, or even more.  Feel free to open
Github issues for suggestions or suspected problems, but please don't expect me
to volunteer any time to respond or otherwise address them directly.  Think of
Github issues for this project as a way to document something you'd like me to
be aware of when fixing problems or implementing future requirements.
